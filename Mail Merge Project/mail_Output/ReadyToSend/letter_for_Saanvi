Dear Saanvi,

I hope this message finds you well. I am excited to share that my birthday is coming up, and I would love to have you join me in celebrating this special day!

The party will be held on Saturday, and it would mean a lot to me if you could come. There will be fun, food, music, and great company—everything needed for a memorable evening.

Please let me know if you’ll be able to make it. I truly hope you can join us!

Looking forward to celebrating with you.

Warm regards,
Ankush
